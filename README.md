# Deliverables:

- [X] A design-doc that describes the problem-solving process for all the above problems. For each problem, include the following aspects: 
    - [X] input and output of the problem
    - [X] your algorithm in pseudo code with comments
    - [X] worst-case time complexity analysis
    - [X] your choice of data structures with a brief justification in the final coding stage (e.g., "We declared a user-defined struct for ... because ...")
- [ ] Your program files.  one for each problem.  Each program file will consist of the following information:
    - [x] A header file: 
        - [X] the function prototype to generate x uniformly distributed random numbers 
        - [X] the function prototype to generate x random numbers following a specified normal distribution
        - [x] the function prototype to calculate the underlying data of a histogram, given a collection of numbers
        - [/] the function prototype to print out a histogram using a user-specified symbol (e.g., *)
        - [X] the function prototype of the partition subroutine that's shared by the quickSort and k-th ranked  object algorithms
        - [X] the function prototype of the almost generic quicksort algorithm
        - [X] the function prototype of the almost generic k-th ranked algorithm
- [X] your CPP file with comments
    - [X] define the above functions
- [X] a header file consisting of your unit tests: 
    - [X] at least two unit tests per function

1. generate a histogram of 20,000 randomly generated integer numbers according to a normal distribution with a user-specified mean and standard deviation.

2. generate a histogram of 20,000 randomly generated floating-point numbers according to a uniform distribution with a user-specified range.

3. implement an almost generic randomized-QuickSort algorithm to sort an array of TokenFreq objects by a given sorting criterion. To realize this, you will use

function templates 
function objects, Lambda expressions, or a pointer to functions
4. implement an almost generic algorithm (the randomized version) to find the k-th ranked object in an array without first sorting this array.  Same as above, you will use. function templates and function objects.

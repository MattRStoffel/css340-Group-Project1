# Design Doc 

### Coding Conventions:

    K&R indentation style
    - opening brace at the next line on the same indentation level as its header, the statements within the braces are indented, and the closing brace at the end is on the same indentation level as the header of the function at a line of its own

### Functions: Inputs and Outputs

**Normal Distribution:** 
    Parameters: # of integers to generate, user specified mean, user specified standard deviation
    Output: 

**Uniform Distribution:** 
    Parameters: # of floating-point integers to generate, user specified range
    Output:

**Almost Generic QuickSort Algorithm:**
    Parameters:
    Output:

**Almost Generic Find k-th ranked object Algorithm:**
    Parameters:
    Output:

### Pseudo-Code:

**Normal Distribution:**

1. generate n random integers following a normal distribution, where n is the total count of integers to be produced 
   - use random generator and normal_distribution in std library 
   - O(n) 
   - mean and standard deviation are user-specified
2. generate a histogram with the data (TODO)


**Uniform Distribution:**

1. generate n random integers following a uniform distribution, where n is the total count of integers to be produced
    - use random generator and uniform_distribution in std library
    - O(n)
    - range is user-specified
2. generate a histogram with the data (TODO)

### Data Structures, etc:

vectors were preferred over arrays for storing random floats/integers generated by RandomGenerator functions because vectors can be returned directly from a function, but arrays would need to be returned as a pointer, which could complicate memory management and increases the risk of manual de-allocation errors.
